                <p>Blaze-The Fiery Phoenix is, as given by the name, flamed by his will to remain immortal and young
                    forever. He liked everything about youth, and the energy it had held. Unlike the villains who would
                    bewitch the world with beauty, Blaze just wanted immortality to soar high into the sky so that he could
                    have the honour to meet his mentor, The Sun. <br> <br>
                    But life was never a cakewalk for Blaze. No one was ever good to Blaze as he was the best-looking one
                    among them all and he was the only one who could code. His feathers shone brighter than the light
                    reflecting from oceans in the day. Hence, no one missed a chance to grab some of his feathers and soon
                    enough, Blaze lost them all and became an old bald bird that couldn’t fly. He was devastated and his
                    dream to be young and soar high seemed to have shattered. That’s when his mentor’s words echoed in his
                    mind. “Every problem comes with a breakthrough and the one who fails to find one never gets one”. Blaze
                    started to wail for the Sun to ask him what he could do but received no response.
